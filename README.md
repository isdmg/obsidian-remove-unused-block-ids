# Remove Unused Block IDs
A simple plugin that removes unused block IDs.

## Caution
Back up your files before using this plugin to prevent any data loss which may occur when the plugin works unexpectedly.

## Limitations
- If a block id is referenced in a canvas card and not anywhere else, it will be added to the unused block IDs list.
- If a page has duplicate block ids, the plugin will not work as expected. (It will fail to distinguish which block is used or not).

## How to use?
Open the command palette and run the command **Remove Unused Block IDs: Scan vault**.
